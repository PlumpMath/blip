## A small simple game I made for the Itch.io Game Off
The goal is to navigate the submarine through the sea mines, using your sonar to actually see where the mines are.
Each sonar ping makes the submarine go faster and faster so it's best to use it as little as possible and try to remember best you can where the mines are.

It's my first time making a game so it's pretty simplistic. Also my first time using Lua and Love2d as well.
It's a pretty fun framework to get something out quickly, even for someone who has no clue how to probably code a game.

## Installation
It needs Love2d to run. I'll try to provide osx and exe as well
